Yes, you can prepare a preinstalled Windows environment on a USB drive using command-line tools without going through the interactive installation process. This process involves copying Windows installation files to the USB and configuring the boot environment. Here’s a streamlined guide using `DISM` and `BCDBoot` commands.

### Steps to Preinstall Windows on a USB Using Command Line

#### 1. **Prepare the USB Drive**:

- Insert the USB drive into a Windows PC.
- Open **Command Prompt** as Administrator.

Run `diskpart` to prepare the USB for a BIOS legacy Windows installation:

```cmd
diskpart
list disk
select disk X      # Replace X with the USB drive number
clean
create partition primary
format fs=ntfs quick   # For large files, NTFS is needed
active                 # Marks the partition as active for BIOS boot
assign letter=E        # Assign a drive letter (e.g., E)
exit
```

#### 2. **Apply the Windows Image**:

- Insert your Windows installation media (or mount the ISO) and note its drive letter (e.g., D).
- Use the `DISM` tool to apply the Windows image (install.wim) to the USB drive.

```cmd
dism /apply-image /imagefile:D:\sources\install.wim /index:1 /applydir:E:\
```

- Replace `D:\sources\install.wim` with the path to `install.wim` on your installation media.
- `E:\` is the root of the USB drive.

#### 3. **Configure the Bootloader**:

- After copying the Windows image, set up the bootloader using `BCDBoot`:

```cmd
bcdboot E:\Windows /s E: /f BIOS
```

This configures the USB drive to boot in BIOS mode.

#### 4. **Prepare for Transfer to Boot Camp Partition**:

- Now you have a USB drive with a preinstalled Windows system that can boot in BIOS mode.
- You can proceed to transfer this preinstalled system to the Boot Camp partition on your MacBook by cloning or copying the files over as outlined before.

### Steps to Clone Windows Using `dd` and Recreate the Hybrid MBR with `gdisk`

1. **Identify Disk and Partition Information**:

   - Open **Terminal** and use `diskutil list` to identify the Boot Camp partition (`/dev/disk0s4`, for example).
   - Also, identify the USB disk with the preinstalled Windows (`/dev/disk2`, for example).

2. **Use `dd` to Copy Windows Data**:

   - Unmount both the USB drive and Boot Camp partition:

     ```bash
     sudo diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2  # USB drive identifier
     sudo diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk0s4  # Boot Camp partition identifier
     ```

   - Use `dd` to copy the Windows data:

     ```bash
     sudo dd if=/dev/disk2 of=/dev/disk0s4 bs=4M
     ```

   This will copy the USB’s Windows data to the Boot Camp partition.

   **Note**: `dd` will overwrite partition data, including the existing MBR structures, which is why you need to reconfigure the hybrid MBR next.

3. **Install and Open `gdisk`**:

   - Install `gdisk` if it’s not already on your system:

     ```bash
     brew install gdisk
     ```

   - Start `gdisk` on your primary disk (e.g., `/dev/disk0`):

     ```bash
     sudo gdisk /dev/disk0
     ```

   - ...
